## âœ¨ Overview
This project implements a fully automated, self-regulating aeroponic vertical greenhouse system leveraging technologies like:

- Precision misting and vertical growing techniques for rapid, sustainable cultivation
- C-based control logic analyzing sensor data to actuate pumps, lights, vents
- Dense sensor suite (11+) measuring temperature, humidity, nutrients, Roots moisture, and other parameters
- Real-time control algorithms implemented in C to translate sensor data into control decisions
- Cloud integration via WiFi for remote monitoring, control, and predictive analytics
- Arduino Cloud IoT for web and mobile dashboards to monitor, control, and analyze the system
## ðŸ’» Technical Implementation
- Dual microcontroller architecture (Arduino Due ARM Cortex M3 + Node MCU ESP8266) for edge intelligence and WiFi
- Digitally calibrated sensors interfaced via I2C/SPI/Analog for comprehensive monitoring
- Control and analysis algorithms implemented in C for responsiveness and efficiency
- UART communication between microcontrollers, MQTT protocol for cloud connectivity
- JSON encoding of sensor data for serialization and transmission to cloud and between the microcontrollers
- Local control for real-time response, cloud for big data capabilities
- Modular IoT framework built on PlatformIO adaptable across scales
